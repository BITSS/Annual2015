# Annual2015
Materials for the 2015 BITSS Annual Meeting Dec 10-11, 2015, held in Berkeley, CA.

Welcome! This repository contains the materials for the optional hands-on training Thursday morning before the main conference.
There are three important folders:

1. slides--contains a set of intro slides written in beamer (LaTeX).
2. Rmarkdown-Stata--contains files for writing a simple dynamic document using R Markdown in R Studio with knitr. Also contains files to run a two-step somewhat-dynamic document version of things using Stata and LaTeX separately. (This folder has its own Readme.)
3. haghish--contains files from Haghish with a demo of a native-Stata dynamic document (Ketchup)

Slides from other presenters (Leamer-Rosenthal, SSMART, research papers, etc.) can be found on the linked OSF project page.
