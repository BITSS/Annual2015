# Annual2015
Materials for the 2015 BITSS Annual Meeting Dec 10-11, 2015, held in Berkeley, CA.

Welcome! This repository contains the materials for the optional hands-on training Thursday morning before the main conference. We we will be focusing on software tools for a reproducible workflow, specifically dynamic documents in both R and Stata. ([Dynamic documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) are ones that contain code, analysis, and output all in one place, for better organization and reproducibility.)

There are three important folders:

1. slides--contains a set of intro slides written in beamer (LaTeX).
2. Rmarkdown-Stata--contains files for writing a simple dynamic document using R Markdown in R Studio with knitr. Also contains files to run a two-step somewhat-dynamic document version of things using Stata and LaTeX separately. (This folder has its own Readme.)
3. haghish--contains files from Haghish with a demo of a native-Stata dynamic document (Ketchup)

In order to work with these files, you're going to need to have several software programs installed. We will be running a demo of them, but it will likely be a lot more useful if you try and follow along on your own.

1. [LaTeX](https://latex-project.org/ftp.html) (install--this is a pretty big download. Definitely don't leave this until the day of.)
2. [OSF](http://osf.io) (no install, just make an account)
3. [GitHub.com](http://github.com) (make an account)
4. [Git](https://desktop.github.com/) (install--this actually links to GitHub Desktop, which includes Git)
5. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (install)
6. [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) (install)
7. [Stata] (sorry, we can't help you get a copy of this.)

Slides from all other presenters (Leamer-Rosenthal, SSMART, research papers, etc.) can be found on the linked OSF project page.
