Dynamic Documents in Stata
==========================

This folder contains files with examples of dynamic documents in Stata, using [Haghish's](http://www.haghish.com/home.php) MarkDoc, Weaver, and Ketchup. (We'll focus on MarkDoc.)

The .pdf contains an overview and description of how to write good dynamic documents. In order to get started, run the following in Stata:

ssc install markdoc

ssc install ketchup

ssc install weaver

ssc install synlight

(If you happen to have installed these previously, make sure they're up to date by running 'adoupdate')
